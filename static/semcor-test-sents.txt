So he wound up with a dozen.
Palmer's dozen were honestly earned.

Cherkasov does not caricature him, as some actors have been inclined to do.
The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an ``island'' is one of the best in the film.
If so, it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department - one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents.
The jazz buff could hardly ask for more.
``Chicago and All That Jazz'' may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer.
Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : A much more girlish Lucia, a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing, and an actress immersed in her role.
He may respect too much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes, but to restrain them in a singers' opera may be quite difficult.
You will need a stereo music system, with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart, and one or more of the new London ``Phase 4'' records.
These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record.
All of the releases, however, are recorded at a gratifyingly high level, with resultant masking of any surface noise.
The storyline, in sort, is wildly unrealistic.
Yet for much of the globe, Hollywood is just that - prime, if not sole, source of knowledge.
His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless.
The cast:
Not altogether a successful play, ``Epitaph for George Dillon'' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling.

I'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this ``Fiorello!''
``Where the Boys Are'' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy.
As a result, although we still make use of this distinction, there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed.
Demons, fairies, angels, and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars.
All this has not, however, been an unmixed blessing.
The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures, foibles, irritations, and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age.
If one asks about this play, what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power, there is no better answer to give than ``spirit''.
In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play, he says at one point : ``However, that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer's many faced lieutenants.
It is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect.
So it is too with many other spirits which we all know : the spirit of Nazism or Communism, school spirit, the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team, the spirit of Rotary or the Ku Klux Klan.
It is for them a given which they and they alone possess.
But this statement is completely unconvincing.
This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's ``cult of reassurance'' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel.
And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume, as we too often do, that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men.
To say this, of course, is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years, or, at any rate, since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought.
However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations, the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism, not behind it.
Hence, if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected, it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted; for, in either event, the first possibility is excluded.
For ``the tide is well on the turn'', as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written.
``When you pile your'' guy ``on the bonfire tomorrow night, I wonder how much of the true story of Guy Fawkes you will remember?
From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services.
Still, it is clear from such reports, and apparently clear from the remarks of many people, that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing.
They hope, of course, to reclaim the non-Catholic population to the Catholic faith, and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by heart the ``Prayer for England'':
One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities.
Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid Victorian England.
Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that ``Catholics, if the present system is still in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation''; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.
Each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human history and human death, coming as the head of a new humanity.
Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private individuals, but as universal human beings, who were and are all of humanity.
He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall; for he was created not exactly immortal, nor yet exactly mortal, but capable of immortality as well as of mortality.
And even as she, having indeed a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin, having become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and to the entire human race; so also did Mary, having a man betrothed [ to her ], and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, become the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race''.
The wages of sin is death.
It is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next.
One night, so some of these theories run, Adam would have fallen asleep, much as he fell asleep for the creation of Eve; and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal.
After all, a guy's gotta have a little ego!
Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds, and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight.
``It never seemed to widen, it just got longer and longer''.
You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs.
But as you can also see, it's not a painful exercise at all, because Henri de Courcy - the ``happy'' bodybuilder - looks as though he were having the time of his life!
Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set, high-rep, light weight workouts.
The One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts.
You'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's done:
But don't worry.
Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care.
Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies.
Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby.
Pansies are gluttons.
I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost.
That cold frame was my morale builder; its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it.
Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed.
Would you like to grow exhibition pansies?
You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted.
The fruit is then cooled to 42 ` F., a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state.
Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system.
But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers, the work presents its problems.
Whether considered alone or in relation to other editions, COLH 40 is a document of prime importance.
About the Pro Arte's contribution I am less happy.
The assisting musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise, but their contribution is rustic and appealing.
Helmut Roloff, playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble, gives a sturdy reading, in much the same vein as that of the last mentioned pianists.
Since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago, the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold.
Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion, although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests.
A contributing factor is the perspective, the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained.
Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm, the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect.
The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts between ultra vehement brute power and chilly, if suave, sentimentality.
The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site.
County judges, commissioners, engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences.
What are the existing recreation features?
It may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake, colorful rock formations, or unusual trees.
The amount of water frontage, the quantity and quality of the water, and the recreation afforded by it are important.
The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them.
Notice should be taken of unusual rock formations, deposits, or shapes of the earth's crust in your region.
Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones.
Nearly level areas are required for parking areas, beaches, camp areas, ball fields, etcetera.
The extent and location of open areas is noted.
The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics.
But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one, endurance.
First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension, since action relieves both.
American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons.
Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular dance work, but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility.
Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin up each time they pass under it.
Start on the knees in a large circle.
Handstands come after arms, chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength.
Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper.
Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover.
For most small children, learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can.
It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative.
The American Institute of Interior Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course.
Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval.
The old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations.
Consultation with architects, clients, real estate men, fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work.
The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice.
No one can deny that these ``back door'' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies.
In all ``degree'' courses in interior design a number of ``academic'' or ``general studies'' courses are included.
Most professors in the course must, naturally, again have a higher degree than the course offers.
There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you, wondering why you are staring, open-mouthed in amazement.
Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the ``jargon'' of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered ``how, or why, had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film''?
And when psychology explains glibly, ``but the subconscious mind is able to produce it'' it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind.
A ``mental image'' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought, or consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream, but within the depths of the fourth dimension.
So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal, apparently momentary states of matter, successive one after another in consciousness, but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies.
If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams, however bizarre their combinations, denies that it is purely a composition of the brain, it must be compounded from views of diverse realities, although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life.
that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal, gradient frequencies, across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met?
But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene.
Yes, the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything, he assured her.
``You have it, all right.
Leaving Lee's office, Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician, who treated her for burned tissue.
The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals, wires, and radio parts.
Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland.
The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important, of course.
``Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor's treatments''.
``Hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy, and its rays will cure any disease you have'', said the company.
He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $ 5 to $ 10 from survivors of patients who had died, reconditioning them, and selling them at $ 185 each.
Says Wallace F. Jannsen, director of the FDA's Division of Public Information : ``Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people, or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism, diabetes, and cancer.
2) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others, it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness.
Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes.
2) The concept that an ``American national folklore'' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.
As long as his material is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears ``democratic'' to his audience, he remains satisfied.
They have widely varying backgrounds and aims.
Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines.
And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone.
Robert Frost, for instance, writes about rural life in New England, but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems.
Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties.
In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom, and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded, one minute shows.
For a moment or two, both scenes are present simultaneously, one growing weaker, one growing stronger.
Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen, at the rate, for silent movies, of 16 frames per second, and, for sound films, 24 frames per second.
Overnight, for one thing, Porter's film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten.
Each scene is shot straight through, as had been the universal custom, from a camera fixed in a single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's camera position breaks, necessarily, with the camera position standard until then, which had been, roughly, that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play.
If, in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends, you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's grandmother watching this event, you have begun to be an artist in film; you are employing the basic technique of film; you are cutting.
The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence; these films and these sequences are also seeking out - instinctively or by design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative.
In all of this extensive and expensive effort, the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author.
The race problem has tended to obscure other, less emotional, issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive.
- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it.
Time's editor, Thomas Griffith, in his book, The Waist High Culture, wrote : ``most of what was different about it (the Deep South) I found myself unsympathetic to''.
The strong feeling is certainly there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South, especially among those who studied in the North.
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South.
Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors.
Or else the North really believes that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past, and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream, like everybody else.
Had the situation been reversed, had, for instance, England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England, there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain.
They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America.
Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes.
The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme.
We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets.
But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating.
Yet we no longer feel uneasy.
He does not know whether to look up or look aside, to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side, to cross the street, or to continue on the same side.
Small wonder, then, that we fear.
In some areas, the progress is slower than in others.
The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe.
``A miracle, a revelation, it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude''.
This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art; it is particularly the artist (Tonio Kro^ger, Aschenbach, Leverku^hn) who suffers from it.
Something of this can be learned from ``The Way to the Churchyard'' (1901), an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure.
Thus, on the highroad, a troop of soldiers ``marched in their own dust and sang'', while on the footpath one man walks alone.
Then an ambulance comes along, and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away.
The cyclist, by contrast, blond and blue-eyed, is simply unreflective, unproblematic Life, ``blithe and carefree''.
The monk Savonarola, brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century, protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art shop of M. Bluthenzweig; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled, according to gossip, upon the painter's mistress.
Practical management problems and their suggested solutions are dealt with in a series of SBA publications.
SBA serves also as a clearing house for information on products and processes particularly adaptable for exploitation by small firms.
Each SBA regional office also maintains a ``want'' list of surplus property, principally machinery and equipment, desired by small business concerns in its area.
Small Business Administration, What It Is, What It Does, SBA Services for Community Economic Development, and various other useful publications on currently important management, technical production, and marketing topics are available, on request, from Small Business Administration, Washington 25, D.C..

To be eligible to borrow from a Bank for Cooperatives, a cooperative must be an association in which farmers act together in processing and marketing farm products, purchasing farm supplies, or furnishing farm business services, and must meet the requirements set forth in the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended.
If nothing is produced, there is no obligation to repay.
This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet, although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence.
Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves, although opaque to infrared radiation.
It should be possible, however, to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers.
The radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter wave lengths, except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio noise.
These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude.
The result of the observations is (in ` K) **f where the phase angle, |qt, is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors.
The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount.
Heat of condensation (work function) plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging on the anode.
An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must, therefore, aim at a reduction of the anode loss.
A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper.
The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk.
This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection.
At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 V (peak to peak) with a resistive load.
The lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable.
It was denoted by **f.
The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of **f.
It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims.
The face of one block contained a hole 1 16'' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure.
These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight.
The actual change * * f caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume, just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head.
This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields.
From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the * * f calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face.
(B) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid, the internal pressure is the same in all directions.
Measurements on the photograph in this paper give * * f at the maximum rate of shear of * * f.
This conformational entropy is, in this case, equal to the usual entropy, for there are no other changes or other energies involved.
Hence, the electron paramagnetic effects (slope) can be separated from the nuclear effects (intercept).
Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the **f bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid.
Douglass found **f to be trigonal, Laue symmetry **f, with **f, **f.
The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds.
Position (2) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural grounds.
A very fine, gray solid (about 15 g) is formed, water-washed by centrifugation, and dried at 110 ` C.
However, **f adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss.
The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing a Varian model **f broad line spectrometer and the associated 12 - inch electromagnet system.
This measurement was obtained by W. Blumberg of the University of California,Berkeley, by observing the breadth of the free induction decay signal.
The measured powder density of the **f used here was about **f, approximately one-third that of the crystal density (**f).
The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty, spray-dried detergent formulations for household use.
Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium, a solid substrate, soil to be removed, and the detergent or surface-active material.
A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings; whereas, with a poor formulation, the clothes exhibit a build-up of ``tattle-tale grey'' and dirty spots - sometimes with bad results even after the first wash.
In hard surface cleaning, the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active.
Miscellaneous soils, which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue.
The washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts, to some extent, as a dissolving and solvating agent.
Obviously hydrophobic (oleophilic) substances such as greases, oils, or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase.
Thus, for aqueous media, we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent, and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent.
Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process, it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having ``synergistic'' properties has gained widespread acceptance.
The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies.
To prepare the latter, silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing * * f obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
The contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking, redistributed to the reaction tubes, frozen down, and each tube was then sealed off.
The light was filtered by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell.
Following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent, a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine, to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes.
Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings.
.
At one astronomical unit from the sun (the Earth's distance) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular.
Even in the neighborhood of the Earth, where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly, the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude.
The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth.
On May 15, a very large increase occurred with * * f of mass between * * f and * * f; for the next two days, the impact rate was * * f; and for the next nine days, the impact rate was less than * * f (Nazarova, 1960).
Being based on so few events, these results are of dubious validity.
The threshold mass of about * * f corresponds to a 10 - | m diameter sphere of density * * f.
The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors.
Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites.
Most meteoritic material, by the time it reaches the Earth's surface, has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere.
A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases.
The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract, such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi, are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence.
There are, of course, certain times during the 24 - hour daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met.
Zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated.
In this test, 130 gallons of a suspension, having a count of * * f organisms per ml, or a total of approximately * * f spores, was aerosolized.
This suggests that the sampling period, particularly at the more distant locations, should have been increased.
In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure, one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of ``rabbit fever'' on a finger.
There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made.
Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics.
In this case, then, the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack.
The air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack.
Fahey and Morrison used a single, continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti - A and anti - B agglutinins from preisolated | g-globulin samples.
Anti - A and anti - B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A, group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods.
The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ABO samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37 ` C before centrifugation.
This buffer, pH 8.6, was 0.005 M in * * f and 0.039 M in tris (hydroxymethyl) - aminomethane (Tris).
These were read at 280 m | m in a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer and tested for antibody activity as described above.
Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2, ionic strength 0.154.
These have been labeled Regions 1, 2, and 4, respectively, in Fig. 1.
These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity, using fractions from group AB plasma as a control.
In fact agglutination of * * f cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing ``only'' incomplete antibody activity.
The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble : honeybees, bumblebees, and other wild bees, and also various kinds of flies.
As we have already seen in the first chapter, bumblebees are bigger, hairier, and much more colorful than honeybees, exhibiting various combinations of black, yellow, white and orange.
The queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen, taking a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots.
The young queens and drones leave the nest and mate, and after a short period of freedom, the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter.
The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the case of the idler, Psithyrus, lack the pollen baskets - naturally!
One of my favorites is A. armata, a species very common in England, where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee.
In the Sacramento valley in California, for instance, it has been observed that there was not one day's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins.
Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees.
The thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist; yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either.
It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves.
I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet.
These three were much alike : lined snake (Tropidoclonion), one year and nine months; red-bellied snake (Storeria), two years; cottonmouth (Ancistrodon), two years.
The first is the strictly scientific, which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh.
His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength, but these seem to be given to complete his picture, not to be believed.
William Beebe reports 26 inches and 2.4 ounces (this snake must have been emaciated) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British Guiana.
The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto Lamon, a petroleum geologist of the Richmond Oil Company, and reported in 1944 by Emmett R . Dunn.
However, as so many of the records are not certainly based on newborn snakes, these data must be taken tentatively; final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods from definite localities.
Another marked difference is noted here.
Distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other, as in type 1, (fig. 24).
An unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted.
The volume and, perhaps, even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse.
In 1951, this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz.
One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1, or 2,.
In other words, the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts.
Also, for the present, great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man.
In types 1, 2, and 3, the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole.
The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence.
The upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation, and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation.
The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood.
The differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows.
This difference is readily clarified by referring to Table 1.
Forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this monograph have been included in the Appendix.
With due consideration for the limits of precision in assessing, expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years, and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement, each arrow with a ``shaft length'' of four months or less was selected as indicating ``same schedule'' at Onset and Completion, for this particular epiphysis.
After the 42 figures had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6, classifications of the onset ages and completion ages were summarized from them.
In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins (chiefly thyroglobulin) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated.
In addition, depending on availability of dietary iodine, thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine.
It is assumed that the iodine released from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid, where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin.
The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out, but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin (Astwood, 1954).
There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen, which is then secreted in the milk.
The name thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so far tested for its presence.
Albert (1949) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period, from 1931 to 1945, were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material.
Whether this abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH, or is, alternatively, normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent, cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary TSH.
This patient was a 65 - year old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26, 1959, because of disabling weakness and general debility.
Because of increasing anemia, triamcinolone, 8 mg. daily, was started on Feb. 23, 1958, and was continued until july, 1958.
No fasciculations or sensory defects were found.
In May 1959, prednisone, 30 mg. daily, replaced the dexamethasone.
On July 4, 1959, the patient developed marked abdominal pain and distension, went into shock, and died.
The intimal surface of the aorta was covered with confluent, yellow-brown, hard, friable plaques along its entire course, and there was a marked narrowing of the orifices of the large major visceral arteries.
There were slight fibrosis and marked arteriolosclerosis.
The submucosa was focally infiltrated with neutrophils.
Throughout, there were marked arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles.
These changes were most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less evident in the pectoralis, diaphragm, and transversus.
Individual nuclei were usually oval to round, though occasionally elongated, and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic.
(3) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade (1957).
Sections were then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes.
In the first few experiments * * f was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder.
In all the above procedures, when the intermediate sera were diluted to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with 0.85 % saline, the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduced, whereas, a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1 : 500 or diluting the * * f to 1 : 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence.
This conjugate was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method.
Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated * * f and * * f, although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells, was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography.
In all cases studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain detectable amounts of WTV antigen.
The specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick walled cells in the xylem region, but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors.
In addition, the neocortical hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates, as Mirsky's interesting experiment on the ``communication of affect'' demonstrates.
Apparently, a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex.
Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals.
This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl test.
Furthermore, conditioned reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level, and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic ``tuning'' are observed.
Being a strictly physiological procedure, one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself.
He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses.
In view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances, it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes.
One sees that this happens because the null space of * * f has dimension 1 only.
Then (a) * * f (b) each * * f is invariant under T (c) if * * f is the operator induced on * * f by T, then the minimal polynomial for * * f is * * f.
Let * * f.
If * * f is the operator induced on * * f by T, then evidently * * f, because by definition * * f is 0 on the subspace * * f.
Let us put * * f.
Then there is a diagonalizable operator D on V and a nilpotent operator N on V such that (a) * * f, (b) * * f.
(Actually, a nilpotent operator on an n-dimensional space must have its nth power 0; if we take * * f above, that will be large enough.
It is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter.
If we are discussing differentiable complex valued functions, then * * f and V are complex vector spaces, and * * f may be any complex numbers.
A function g such that * * f, i.e., * * f, must be a polynomial function of degree * * f or less : * * f.
What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes?
Before deriving this formula, we explain what we mean by ``problems of this kind''.
On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver.
We now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments.
These words are more expressive than labels like ``A'' and ``not - A''.
Thus in the three dice example * * f, * * f, and the independence assumption implies that the probability that the three dice fall ace, not ace, ace in that order is (1 6) (5 6) (1 6).
An experiment consists of the voting of one couple, or two trials.
A binomial experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes.
We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x successes for given values of p and n.
The number of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1, and there are 5 such random variables here.
The square has one corner point on the straight line segment, and does not lie entirely in the interior.
If the vertex is at **f, and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t, then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C clockwise through 90 ` about the vertex.
Each point with abscissa t on the graph represents an intersection between C and **f.
We know that in the C-plane both C and **f are analytic.
It is also seen that **f, since the change from **f to **f is accomplished by a continuous translation.
The first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points in the f-plane, the end points of which fall into category (b) or (c).
The number of ordinary values of the function f (t) at t will be called its multiplicity at t.
We have shown that the graph of f contains at least one component whose inverse is the entire interval [ 0, T ], and whose multiplicity is odd.
We first define a function b (t) as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on C and vertex at t, b (t) is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences between t and the backward corner points.
Nevertheless, with foresight and careful planning, some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped.
Isolated enterprises have been launched, but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern.
Above all, we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible for their fates.
It should be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society.
Several related tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved.
There are also more basic problems.
We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period of time.
Nevertheless, for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies, though less for the less religious portion, religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions.
Man has the experience of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand; he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement.
Religion at its best is out in front, ever beckoning and leading on, and, as Lippman put it, ``mobilizing all man's scattered energies in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance''.
In providing for these inner individual functions, religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution.
Furthermore, religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values; for example, those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends.
Some of the oldest, most persistent, and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion.
The religion, in fact, is an expression of the unity of the group, small or large.
Religion usually exercises a stabilizing conserving function.
Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion.
The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration, nomination and voting.
Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the French did not even begin until the fall of 1957, this goal appears somewhat ambitious.
The parties were on the whole unprepared for elections, while the people were still experiencing post independence let-down and suffering the after effects of poor harvests in 1957.
In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental, and sometimes bitter, differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance.
Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation.
The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete, precise problems of internal politics.
Centrally, however, the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage.
A goal was fixed, as given in Table 2, and attention focused on its fulfillment.
If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all, that they asserted nothing true or false, but merely expressed emotions like ``Hurrah'' or ``Fiddlesticks'', then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest.
There is perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain is bad.
For what I express in my remark is something going on in me at the time, and that of course did not exist until I did come on the scene.
It removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this, whereas on positivist grounds it should be.
If we did not mean to say this, why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred?
But suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again.
We all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense.
If we were asked why we thought so, we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong, and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting.
If goodness and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them, those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line.
We do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself.
Obviously, a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative, if the argument is to get under way at all, for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion, any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether, of course, as evidence to establish the desired conclusion.
It seems clear, when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient (we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question, the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient), that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision.
If, however, the figure to be discerned were complicated, composed of several interlocking subfigures, and so on, even the tracing process failed him, and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts.
This would mean, it can readily be seen, that, again, for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery.
How, then, do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this?
Throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm, severe serenity displays itself.
While Protogeometric vases usually turn up, especially outside Greece proper, together with as many or more examples of local stamp, these ``non Greek'' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century.
Further we cannot go, for the Dark ages deserve their name.
The first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change.
The dominant pottery of the century was Geometric; political organization revolved about the basileis; trade was just beginning to expand; the gods who protected the Greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress.
The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years, the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century, display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance.
To the ancestral lore, however, new materials were added.
Three weeks later following his recovery, armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney, Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez.
After spending two nights (Wednesday and Thursday) in Catskill, the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business.
Noticing Russell's horse in front of the long log building, he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight, so he began working his way down the ditch to join him.
The officer demanded the names of the injured men; the Mexicans not only refused to give them, but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it.
They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property, thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the Vermejo, and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot.
Still there was no Gonzales and the family would say nothing.
Not realizing the seriousness of the wound, the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him.
Occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills, disappearing at the posse's approach.
It has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill.
The final step was a vote for a $ 230000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by the 1959 town meeting, later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town meeting June 21, 1960.
The Manchester Journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business.
Two companies now had headquarters with Clark J. Wait, who by then had his own drugstore at Factory Point - the ``Northern Union Telegraph Company'' and the ``Western Union''.
In 1914 when the town was chosen for the U. S. Amateur Golf tournament, a representative hurried here from the Boston manager's office.
In November 1887 a line connecting several dwelling houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester Depot.
In 1931 Mrs. F. H. Briggs, agent and chief operator, who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years' service, led agency offices in sales for the year with $ 2490.
On June 14, 1900 the Manchester Journal reported that an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for Edward S. Isham at ``Ormsby Hill''.
At about the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under way, the Vail Light and Lumber Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington Co-operative Creamery, intending to use its surplus power for generating electricity.
It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon, and quite clearly in More's lexicon, the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous, and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn.
Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century.
What is new about it?
Platonic, Stoic, early Christian, monastic, canonist or theological communism; we are concerned with Utopian communism - that is, simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia, as More conceived it.
To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors in spirit, the monastic communities, is with an appropriate shift of adjectives, misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato's Republic:
We should think of it more as an act of justice than compassion''.
In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it, Utopian communism remains, as an integral whole, original - a new thing.
During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence.
Upon receiving the news, Northern writers, editors, and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states, particularly Virginia.
Concerning the sentence, Foss wrote, ``If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John Brown's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment, it would be well - well for the country and for Virginia''.
In reference to Brown's raid she wrote, ``though we are non-resistants and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapons we know thee was anemated [ sic ] by the most generous and philanthropic motives''.
The Newport Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him.
In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled.
Although admitting Brown's guilt on legal grounds, Day said that, ``Brown is no common criminal; his deed was not below, but above the law''.
Whereas, John Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper:
In certain other pictures, however, Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing.
By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness, the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done.
The trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses, but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it.
Depicted, Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal, undepicted kind, but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind - and it does so, moreover, without depriving the latter of its literalness; rather, it underpins and reinforces that literalness, re-creates it.
In the end, Picasso and Braque plumped for the representational, and it would seem they did so deliberately.
But even before that, Picasso had glimpsed and entered, for a moment, a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him.
As it affects the city's fiscal situation, such an interchange is ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services.
This movement of industry away from the central cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe.
They are all suburban plants, relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers.
In spreading the factories even farther, the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities.
Telephone orders distort the picture:
Indeed, there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown.
Historically in America the appeal of cities has been their color and life, the variety of experience they offered.
The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume.
The sewage system from Kansas City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years.
It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development.
The aerator had a variable speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds.
Grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions.
The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage.
A skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids.
This low BOD was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during this study.
Only once were stalked ciliates found in the mixed liquor.
Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover.
A single 24 - hr composite sample had a BOD of 260 mg / l, indicating a typical domestic sewage.
His teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that, if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home, there was little danger of his losing a term.
I recommend it''.
He breathed now with his mouth open, showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth; he kept his eyes, with their puffed blurred lids, always lowered, though not, apparently, focusing.
Rachel said, ``I'd better get him to bed''.
He felt tired and full and calm.
Both watched Scotty constantly, Rachel without seeming to, Virginia openly, her eyes filled with concern.
At these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest, but it was an objective pain, in no way different from others in intensity and not different in kind; it was like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throbbed; it was merely another part of his weakness.
They were far off and looked tiny.
``I imagine you're always battling in school''.
He'll be stronger soon''.
He had no desire to.
She says the children miss you.
She was very worried''.
She put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed.
Or : ``Does he get exercise''?
``I'm not supposed to yet''.
Gouge, burn, blast, insult it as they would, could anyone really take Papa-san?
If he were to go with White, he would be out there two days, not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san, but moving ever deeper into enemy land - behind Papa-san itself.
He hadn't even seen him yet.
Others carried extra clips for the Browning Automatic Rifle, which was in the hands of a little Mexican named Martinez.
At 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the point of departure.
A foot misplaced, a leg missing.
They were going to follow it for part of their journey.
The dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage, their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords.
The patrol was stopping.
The walk and his fears had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch of the night air.
In France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky, and always as he wandered, he felt a stranger to their exultation.
They crowded the small room and peered over one another's shoulders to watch the handless man write his name in the book.
The Americans, like yourself, take the fact for granted, try to be helpful, but don't ask questions.
``Will you please wait in here.
She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash, and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury.
He had a mean, unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit, and someone invented the name Trig for him.
The fear of punishment just didn't bother him.
The Colonel ordered that it be wiped out, and I suggested,' You ask for volunteers, and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky, ten dollars and a week-end pass to Davao'.
The colored boy had it, and Trig lunged at him with a knife and said,' Give that to me, you black bastard.
These were heroes nine feet tall to him''.
He made the decision with his eyes open, or so he thought.
More of this stamping down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New York.
The Vice President had called and asked if he could see the Secretary at his home.
Therefore, he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point of view.
He merely said, ``Any good decorator these days can make you a tasteful home''.
How best to destroy your peace?
Let me tell you what happened to me today.
The city was a center of manufacture, especially in textiles, and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings, a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama.
For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead, and the city mourned him.
It sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor.
During the next weeks he looked over the situation.
It really ought to be rebuilt, and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this.
Wilson inquired about it.
The best could not escape from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better.
He emphasized to the Presiding Elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river.
The very proposition was sacrilege.
When a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them.
She said, ``My dear, do you know what Kent House is''?
And after Wilson had talked to Mrs. Catt and to others, he was absolutely amazed.
Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold.
Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse, Seward's home, where Key had once been killed.
He pushed his way inside.
Everything would be all right.
Young Frederick Seward held out his hand.
Reversing it, he smashed the butt down on Frederick Seward's head, over and over again.
A knife would do.
There was a lady there, in a nightdress.
Somewhere in the fog, the nigger boy was still yelling murder.
After some time he came to an open field.
On a stage he always knew what to do, and tonight, to judge by the applause, he must be doing it better than usual.
The commotion had brought her into the wings.
``Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, you sockdologizing old mantrap''! said Trenchard, otherwise Hawk.
They had not heard what had been said.
There was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them.
When something unexpected happened, one always asked for water if one were a woman, brandy if one were a man.
At the rear of the auditorium, upstairs, some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor.
By the look of him he wasn't that far gone.
It was absurd.
He heard himself chortling.
Stevie''!
He came by and repeated, ``Po' Chavis''!
He raced to the window and yanked at the sash.
``There's a tower and a steeple on the church a million feet high.
The Dutch Reformed Church, with two steeples and its own school was on Main Street; the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street; the Catholic Saint Mary's Church, with an even taller steeple and a cross on top, stood on Ball Street.
``We have nine hundred and eleven members in our charge'', Mama announced, ``and three hundred and eighty Sunday-school scholars''.
Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing youth : ``Idle recreation''!
He made a will and last testament before we left Paterson.
The cold, mysterious presence of God was all around him.
Therefore, give Him your affection and store up His love for you.
He would hear the Call and would run to tell Papa.
Lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner!
``Don't you be afraid''!
He jumped.
Ludie had a cigar box full of marbles and shooters, and a Roman candle from last Fourth of July.
He meandered down Pike Street, past the First National Bank with its green window shades.
That's how it should be.
Fresh, warm, sweet and juicy, sweet lovin sixteen, she was.
What I have to put up with!
``I soon came back to my senses'', he said, aloud, to the young blizzard, proudly, drawing himself up, as if making a report to some important superior.
Maybe it's a good thing it happened.
His eyes blinked hard, snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him.
The word also made him feel hate, sincere hate, for those so labeled.
He heard himself haranguing them.
He felt intense satisfaction.
He knew he couldn't.
His old self.
No one is stupid.
Why couldn't they have dumped him off on someone else?
Thoroughly Wised Up.
Lookit it!
Ching, Tien, all of them.
``Yehhh'', said Coughlin, practically spitting on him.
Plenty of room there now.
- name William Foster's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism.
How did they miss him when they got Slater?
``For Christ's sake''! a voice pleaded.
I thought I knew.
I hated the goddamn army from the first day I got in anyhow.
(he asked this out loud, but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut).
He goes to the chief himself.
He is in a hurry to write another essay against culture.
And his efforts to get a performance for his Gallant Muses invariably failed.
``Heaven forbid''! cried the ladies, enchanted by his music.
No.
The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded.
Duclos, the historian, pointed out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible.
No one will even suspect that it is your work''.
``I refused'', Duclos said.
And of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends.
``Why not''?
``If they are here, then surely I have the right to be here'', Rousseau said.
Now times have changed, and I must pretend that hair doesn't grow on my face.
his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself.
Solomon Chandler hadn't misjudged the strength of his lungs, not at all.
The gun would fire or not, just as chance willed.
I must state that the faster things happened, the slower they happened; the passage and rhythm of time changed, and when I remember back to what happened then, each event is a separate and frozen incident.
a voice called, and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant, only some of them glancing toward the stone wall, from behind which the voice came.
Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching.
Cousin Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column, but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road.
I went off with Cousin Simmons, who maintained that if he didn't see to me, he didn't know who would.
Cousin Simmons roared.
But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him.
Monsieur Favre sat down in his high-backed stall, lips compressed, eyes glinting.
He is throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win''!
The Abbot of St. Eloi, Claude de Mommor, had been a good friend, but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in hallowed ground.
The sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated the holes of his shoes, his only ones, now patched with folded parchment.
He brushed back his black hair, shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes.
An occasional traveler from Italy brought news of Peter Robert, who was now distributing his Bible among the Waldensian peasants.
Catholics who were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of days gone by.
Eli Corault!
``Plot''?
Ever since the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of Christ.
Furthermore, Bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council, preach only the word of God and stop meddling in politics''!
He wanted to run, but he knew that if he did, he would be lost.
Somebody heaved a stone.
Then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow.
He had seen a dry, old, yellowing hand reach out, with that painful solicitude, to touch, to rearrange, to shift aimlessly, some object worth a pfennig.
Or was he now taking the role - the gesture and the suffering - because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid, befogged loneliness of this land.
This was the hut of Simms Purdew, the hero.
He thought that if once, only once, he could talk with Simms Purdew, something about his own life, and all life, would be clear and simple.
Adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho.
The feet wore army shoes, in obvious disrepair.
He recognized her because she was the one who, in a winter twilight, on the edge of camp, had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly.
Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain''.
Then he -
He thought : I am a Jew from Bavaria.
He thought of Simms Purdew snoring on his bunk while Pullen James crouched by the hearth, skirmishing an undershirt for lice, and a wet log sizzled.
He thought : Only in my heart can I make the world hang together.
``What is it'' ? he asked.
It is sowbelly with tits on.
Adam shook his head.
She lost not a second, picking herself up and continuing her pilgrimage to Laura.
She admired him.
Southern California gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell, drier, more enervating, more laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer past.
The maid was very black and very energetic, trim in a yellow pique uniform.
``Maybe today'll be a good news day''.
The woman had the glassy look of an invalid, as if she had not slept at all.
The three had little to say to each other.
Mrs. Andrus was talking to the maid, arranging for her to come in every day, instead of the four days she now worked.
When McFeeley was halfway to the door, the proprietor emerged - a mountainous, dark man, his head thick with resiny black hair, his eyes like two of the black olives he imported in boatloads.
The Skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy.
McFeeley noted the immaculate lawn and gardens : each blade of grass cropped, bright and firm; each shrub glazed with good health.
Mr. Kahler went on to explain how Hausman's fox terrier had been ``making'' in his flower beds.
The gas flamed up two inches high.
At the same time, his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here, and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable, peace-loving, and dependable in everybody.
Through the open window they heard sounds below in the street : cartwheels, a tired horse's plodding step, voices.
He realized that he had no idea where the telephone was.
In the room next to theirs was a huge cradle, of mahogany, ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf.
Professor Cestre, could it be?
Beethoven's Fifth was the one on top.
The clock on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room.
They looked, even so.
Barbara asked, as they heard the front door close.
He went down the hall to Eugene's bathroom, to turn on the hot-water heater, and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming trunks.
There it is * * h and there is what was in it.
So something like this matters more than it would at home.
For instance - what about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly, as if this were the one moment they would ever have together, their one chance of knowing each other?
When might Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap?
Jesus' inert body would be passive, his eyes closed.
In particular he sought the gentle, sweet-faced nuns, with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads, remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper.
The Jewish section was in Trastevere, near the Tiber at the church of San Francesco a Ripa.
``But, Rabbi Melzi, you don't object to others creating works of art''?
``Workmen.
Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber.
His image of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman, even as had his memory of his mother.
Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence.
``Argiento, this is senseless'', he complained, not liking to work on the wet floors, particularly in cold weather.
The boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome.
But it would not come.
The scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands.
Kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment.
When she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty.
Kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss.
``Whisky still, my foot'', said Joel.
She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer, after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom.
Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it; of their first engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack's First Brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the B + O Railroad.
Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate's baby and at Jonathan's decision to go with the South ``And, dear Kate'', she wrote, ``poor Dr. Breckenridge's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South, to his good father's sorrow.
Joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate.
Kate greeted him gravely, uneasy with misgivings at his visit.
``When are you to leave''?
She sought Kate out upstairs, her lips trembling.
I have held your papers of manumission since I married Mr. Lattimer''.
``I don't hear the music.
Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house, a Van Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany, from Rensselaerwyck.
He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news.
It had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers.
He drove on, wary and shaken.
On the shores north and south, the fishers and mooncursers - smugglers - lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand, Fire Island.
The chevaux de frise, those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery, pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in.
The road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual; a carriage raising up the choking June dust, and beyond, in a meadow, a local militia company drilling with muskets, Kentuck' rifles, every kind of horse pistol, old sword, or cutlass.
Here he was, suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war, in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories.
Injury and ingratitude would occur.
It is harder, he muttered, to meditate on man (or woman) than on God.
And all this too shall pass away : it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy - yes, in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley, where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those English Dutch manors with their well-fed squires.
The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich, but no one seemed to care.
Where we end our journey is always the same.
He saw the smug eyes of the Home Army chief, Roman, and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him.
I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers' sons of them.
Andrei's skilled eye sized them up.
Early in 1939, Odilo Globocnik, the Gauleiter of Vienna, established SS headquarters for all of Poland.
Stories of the depravity of the guards at Globocnik's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names.
Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw?
``I have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn.
``I'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin''.
I came to Warsaw twice, but there was that damned ghetto wall''.
``Can he be trusted''?
Perhaps if they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation''.
Hell, sir.
``I have sat many hours with this, Styka.
Grabski's shanty was beyond the bridge over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center.
``My cousin works at the Labor Bureau.
Nothing there but Jews''.
Andrei and Styka were silent.
I was crazy about her all over again.
I hate it''.
Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic.
She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed.
I stiffened.
``And don't either of you forget that I'm not any man's property.
I didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone.
And there I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street.
To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night.
Now and then he would disappear for several days.
Eileen seemed to feel the same way.
Now Pat may have been a lecher and a plug-ugly, but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little sister.
It just about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with.
A friend of Pat's named Frank Sposato had just muscled into the Portwatchers' Union.
With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff.
But perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan, that man's ambition when linked with God would be a driving, indefatigable force for good in the world.
He was to get involved in no arguments; he was to try to make no converts; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard.
Without exception Hino's brothers turned to either one or both of their father's occupations, but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller.
``Oh''?
``I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers'', he said.
When he had given the call a few moments thought, he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors, using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission, then he went outside to inspect the grounds.
He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly, just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner.
She has a pretty bad cold''.
``Fine'', Rector said.
It looks pretty efficient and that's the important thing''.
At two thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi's party.
She could act and she could write.
Victory at last!
Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this, it seems, was not employed for self-flagellation.
How was she to behave, Claire wondered.
The fire in the sitting room was lighted.
``Sex is overpriced'', he said.
``I'll tell you nothing.
He drew her close and, hand on cheek, turned her face to his.
He rose and went to the bedroom.
``I was told it on good authority'', Claire answered darkly.
Neither acknowledged the gift.
What about that dear, clever Mr. Thynne?
On all sides doors were being slammed in his face.
Despite his yearning, the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines.
This is no damned holiday, Beckworth.
A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor.
Someone had hauled him over the side, and he had remained silent while they crossed.
The men he would take back across the river stood there, but he turned away from them.
- Yes, sir.
What in the name of God was he doing, crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river?
To tell John something he would find out for himself.
The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current.
The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy, indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs.
He stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge, his weight nearly swamping the craft.
If only there was a clock for him to crawl against.
Watson gesticulated wildly.
Light sticks of fingers, the tips gummy with dark earth, patted at Watson's throat.
- You talk deep.
The man leaned his frail body against Watson's shoulder.
Watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff.
The men mewed and scratched, begging to be taken away.
Yes.
What had he thought of, to go to John, grovel and beg understanding?
Watson spat on the ground.
It would have been like her.
Bomb Berlin!
Mrs. Pastern had been given sixteen names, a bundle of literature, and a printed book of receipts.
Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer.
``I did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans.
``Infectious hepatitis'', he shouted heartily.
Where was Mr. Flannagan, he wondered.
``Mr. Flannagan has been away for six weeks''.
Planes made her feel faint, and in Tokyo, where she had gone that summer, she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home.
The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't know what to make of them, but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there.
Mrs. Pastern asked sadly, when he came in.
He thought first of his son and daughter, away at college.
Then, getting back into bed, he thought unashamedly of Mrs. Flannagan, planning where they would next meet and what they would do.
``Please come down as soon as you conveniently can'', the upright letters stalked from the broad nibbed pen, ``I have an important matter to discuss with you''.
Angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth.
``Yes'', she said, ``I remember that they came here every summer.
Procreation, expansion, proliferation - these are the laws of living things, with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments : oblivion.
Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed, consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years.
They rarely spoke.
They had closed over, absolutely, with the sealing of old Izaak's grave.
Mark easily looked years older than himself, settled, his world comfortably categorized.
He smiled.
There was the day Uncle Izaak had, in an unexpected grandiose gesture, handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps, on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy wished.
Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water, which, there being no moon out, at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars.
The covers slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head, fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed, but his face was turned to the wall - there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster - and I thought, Well you don't look much like a pig-drunk bully now.
I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough.
He told me to wake you''.
``Pedersen''?
``I ain't hid nothing in the crib''.
What did he come for, hey?
Out''.
Out.
That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it.
Did you get the whisky''?
``You'd best get that whisky''.
``Pa don't care about the kid''.
Not Pedersen's kid neither.
It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa's yellow sick insides.
She had surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she'd go, and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have, because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat.
Hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap.
But he'd find out about this one because we were using it.
``No''.
``What are we going to do with these''?
His head flopped back.
``Hold his head up''.
Just hold him like I told you''.
His files, desk, drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos.
He would wear this same costume in Florida, despite his wife Cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him.
And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog, mad as she was at his going away when he really didn't have to, mad at their both got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by.
Then, when he had it pointed down the hill, he stopped to gaze at her through the window.
Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey, yes, was on his way south, and the two boys were away in school, and nothing was burning on the stove, and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers.
Enjoy being a bride while you can''.
When they first married he had been working in the fields all day, and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working, to take him a fresh hot meal.
When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs, she would go to the Big House.
They had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty pound blocks of ice in town, as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there.
``About the same, John, about the same''.
``And who is this'' ? he asked, when she passed him a glass.
``He makes me uncomfortable''.
``Say, did you know they're fixing to have a two day antelope season on the Double X''?
Bobby Joe took a gun from behind the door, and with a quick ``Bye now'' was gone for the day.
But there was no need for Linda Kay to go on, since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and (blushing) raise his children.
``Why, I couldn't even cook a piece of antelope steak; I never even saw any''.
Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum hunting, and Uncle Bill Farnworth (from Mama Albright's side of the family) said he would just get up from there and take them, right then.
He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person; he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights.
``This is my hen ledger'', he informed him in an absorbed way.
It was the doctor, dressed and ready for the expedition to the market, and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste.
The doctor was wearing a long New England greatcoat, hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens.
``Comment'' ? ejaculated the surprised woman, looking at Alex for an explanation but he, parting from her without ceremony, only offered a few words about the doctor's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work.
It was Giselle, the fille de chambre, come to clean the room, and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity, explaining her errand, Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird.
Now you go outside and beckon me when it's safe''.
Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat; unwarranted they were in any case for, as he stood facing the fille de chambre, his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower room.
``Chickens have short memories'', the doctor remarked, ``that's why they are better company than most people I know'', and he went on to break some important news to Alex.
Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool.
She twitched her leg away.
``Here''.
``What room is there going to be in an apartment for any child''?
``Four years''! she wailed.
He doubted whether she heard him, over the running water.
``I don't know what you think you've been doing about my clothes'', he said.
When he was going to town, nothing was good enough - he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace.
That house was ten years off his life.
Since then, the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill.
In the living room, Miss Ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand.
The china lemon tree.
``He's used it every day; every morning, I lay out his clothes on it''.
He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the valet, but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack.
Finally she had come down; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown.
I look like an old man, compared'', and he had picked up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on it.
All I want is a picture - with a few lines.
But that year was different, for just as the city, in the form of my street clothes, had intruded upon my mountain nights, so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I, about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or mess-hall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs, had agreed to correspond.
The weeks went by, and the longer our separation grew, the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became.
It was late, we were playing kissing games, and Jessica and I called on to kiss in front of the others.
It would be the first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved.
I forced confidence into myself.
Times Square, when I ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers (all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members), was nearly impassable, the sidewalks swarming with celebrants, with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey.
Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica?
But when I saw that it was already ten past seven, I began to wonder if something had gone wrong.
He demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano, doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack.
Felix was the exception.
Defining sobriety in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not yet eliminated from the system, you are sober.
``Got the upstairs guy'', he bellows.
He, of course, must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him, but, nonetheless, I did find his reaction startling.
His hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck.
Dark gray sports jacket, lighter gray slacks, pink flannel shirt, black silk necktie.
``You always live up to your name, always like this, always making happy''?
``You live in the present''?
This was more than joy.
Since it is important, for the record let's have the full name''.
Obligingly Gibby lowered his voice.
We followed him up the stairs.
He quickly fixed that, rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others.
The equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition.
Presumably the same sun was shining upon little Drew also, and those who had kidnapped him.
``Our own people.
``She expecting me to''?
Raymond Fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed ``Cradle Song'' in case it was needed.
They overflowed the parking lot, making progress by automobile difficult.
Andy's co-workers kept their distance, awed by the tragedy.
I wouldn't want him to miss the message''.
My men have been here all afternoon, setting up for this thing''.
``No longer than yours.
But Bonner departed, still full of ill will.
When no one smiled, he felt constrained to add, ``Just kidding, natch''.
Andy said, ``Well, I guess we cann't wait any longer.
The act, cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon, had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone.
Yet Andy plowed ahead, mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning, and gradually his listeners warmed to him.
``Ladies and gentlemen, in place of my regular closing number tonight, I'd like to sing something of a different nature for you.
They did; though contemptuous, they were still polite.
The money's here, all of it''.
Thornburg knew, better than any of them, that a public image was as fragile as Humpty Dumpty.
He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room.
He was closer to understanding it in English now, although it could never have the inevitability of the Martian concept it stood for.
My, you look chipper''.
``Come on, there's some cold chicken and we'll see what else''.
Jubal said that his night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up, and Mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it; his foster parents had taught him to see.
``Mike, there's Mars.
``Larry teaches plants to grow.
``You knew him''?
``But now I am not lonely.
A long time later, by cosmic clock, she said, ``Mike?
Oh!
A Tibetan swami from Palermo, Sicily, announced in Beverly Hills a newly discovered, ancient yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction between sexes.
Eternity is no time for recriminations.
You shouldn't have tried to.
If you need a Day off to calm down, duck over to the Muslim Paradise and take it.
Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches.
However, we sent a third vessel out, a much smaller and faster one than the first two.
Macneff smiled and said, ``I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression''.
He was the dormitory gapt when I went to college and thought I was getting away from him.
Perhaps, even, though this is too much to wish, find the Forerunner himself''?
Unfortunately & & &''.
Hal gasped, and he said, ``A divorce''?
Hal, the linguist, saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein.
Its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving tongues, plus a new one called Lingo, a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper.
There was no such thing as an ``accident''.
Perhaps.
``My beloved ward, my perennial gadfly'', said the whining voice.
Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years.
Hal Yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out.
For one thing, the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen's; the sounds made by these organs were, therefore, dissimilar.
All the other parts of speech : nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs.
An hour before, with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness, he would have appreciated company.
``You're right about the fire.
Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled, and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it.
Wilson didn't say anything.
If you want to see'' -
``It doesn't hurt.
He got up slowly, and she was already on her feet, and he stood facing her.
He was tall and dark-skinned, a half-breed, Wilson thought.
The scar looked pure white in the half darkness; his eyes were black and deep-set, and expressionless.
It made Wilson wonder.
Is there anything else you want to know''?
``Oh, no'', he said, and he was without humor now.
Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders, held by the string, and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before.
And determined not to show it.
If she did, he could stand it better in the light.
Well, the grass was there, though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it.
Kathy was already in the wagon.
But there was water.
The place was quiet.
Youth obeyed when commanded.
Without looking at him, without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of her, she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars, rode away in it, and never came back.
``Henh''!
And his eyes - those miniature sundials of variegated yellow - had not altered their expression or direction.
To him they were one and the same.
That was Bartoli's shop.
It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself, but it was not yet time to pay the price.
He would not carry a brief case.
She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence, brushing and drying her wet, gilded hair in the sun.
But the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it.
Pompeii rolled over.
Time enough to give up his soul.
And a witty American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today, ``Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he cann't understand his own meaning''.
Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply don't understand women.
``Good''!
'' What's the name of his other leg ``''?
Readers of the Reader's Digest are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips, like the ad in a California paper that advertised ``House for rent.
We have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people''.
Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star : ``The area in which Miss N - was injured is spectacularly scenic''.

When a customer asked for alligator shoes, she said, ``What size is your alligator''?
An old-fashioned mother said to her modern daughter, ``You must have gotten in quite late last night, dear.
And yet it is not.
``What have you got on today'' ? she inquired.
``That's one thing I've never done'', she said promptly.
One said, ``When I get a cold I buy a bottle of whiskey for it, and within a few hours it's gone''.
``I seem to remember'', he said, ``that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live.
``Can I bear it''?
I took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink, and said, ``I admit that going back to Ralph Waldo Emerson for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy''.
``If we cannot tell evil, horror, and insanity from nonsense, what is the future of humor and comedy''?
``We no longer have Tom Moore's and Longfellow's' heart for any fate ', either'', I said.

``Furiouser and furiouser'', I said.
``Is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species''?
``You think the Russians are getting ahead of us in comedy''?
Moreland asked.
``Now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again'', Moreland protested.
``Great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable'', I said.
The policeman's eyes rather popped for a second; but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry, and she said, ``If it wasn't for these dear children'' -.
I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn''.
``Not the least bit'', Arlene snapped.
Then, Arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful.
``This time'', Arlene said, and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking, ``you're going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing.
They had to be told that one.
Then, they said General Burnside was going to jump over his horse's head; and they did some somersaults.
They were a little late in getting home.
``She really is a dear little thing'', my mother agreed.
Later on, the children told her further about somersaulting.
I opened the window and threw the radish out''.
Sometimes, as at this juncture, he did not.
There was an air of revolt about the children - even irreverence for their own principles.
Eh''?
This was delivered in a forthright way, without coyness and over pretended interest - an admirable way with children.
She was rollickingly happy.
Suddenly, a messenger arrives and, just before collapsing dead at his feet, informs him that the Saracens have invaded Silesia, the home province of his affianced.

As we find out at the end, it is not the stool (symbolizing Doris, therefore the English) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian blind.
For example, to move (as the score requires) from the lowest F major register up to a barely audible N minor in four seconds, not skipping, at the same time, even one of the 407 fingerings, seems a feat too absurd to consider, and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage.
Aging but still precocious, French feline enfant terrible Francoisette Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again, this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The Lascivious Interlude, the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel.
Fing, a lean, chiseled, impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir Cedric Hardwicke, is responsible for the rediscovery of Verdi's earliest, most raucous opera, Nabisco, a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the Mudugno version of ``Volare''.
Quasimodo defines his own art as ``the search for what is not there''.
Far from it; I merely draw an etymological distinction, hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman.
From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath, you abstracted seventeen ivory, metal, wood, and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin, two snuffboxes, and a jade handled magnifying glass.
First of all, the six figures of the Buddha you heisted - four Siamese heads, a black obsidian statuette in the earth touching position, and a large brass figure of the Dying Buddha on a teakwood base.
The three Indian brass deities, though - Ganessa, Siva, and Krishna - are an altogether different cup of tea.
Furthermore - and this, to me, strikes an especially warming note - it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot.
The more I probed into this young man's activities and character, the less savory I found him.

``See that guy'' ? the operator asked pityingly.
The doors of the D train slid shut, and as I dropped into a seat and, exhaling, looked up across the aisle, the whole aviary in my head burst into song.
A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18 th Century ideas; a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times; a brilliant piece de resistance?
Chicago was also a welcome host : there, in 1921, Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the Love for Three Oranges, and played the first performance of his Third Piano Concerto.
After this holocaust, a changing world occupied the minds of men; a world beset with new boundaries, new treaties and governments, new goals and methods, and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation - hunger and exposure.
How right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism.
His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty, clever, adroit, and subtle.
His fellow countryman, Igor Stravinsky, certainly did not.
But time is running out, and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma.
It must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive:
His father, a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter, took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions, and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature.
But even on these, the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off!
But for the technical fact, we have the artist's own testimony:
``If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition, I mean to project equal concern for color.
``As for materials, I use the best available.

He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory, his imagination, his nostalgia.
He was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 (after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930), and elevated to Academicianship in 1940.
Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises, contusions, and simple bursitis.
These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror; the specimen is magnified by the microscope.
Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light, absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum.
The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat, but today's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta, dimensioning of the heart and its chambers, and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat.
A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself.
Battery life limited the use of this ``pill'' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum.
Various methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines, map ocean floors, and even communicate under water.
A typical ``sonogram'' of a human eye, together with a description of the anatomical parts, is shown in Fig. 5.
He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south central part of Denmark on August 14, 1777.
In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University of Copenhagen (founded in 1479) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session.
Han's student days were at a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France, Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent.
The sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him.
During Oersted's attendance at the university, it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences.
His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong.
One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat, which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do.
It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition, Lauritz Esmarch, that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow.
The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820.
Increases rate of gain and improves feed efficiency, aids in the prevention or treatment (depending on level fed) of the early stages of shipping fever, prevents or treats bacterial diarrhea, and aids in reducing incidence of bloat and liver abscesses.
For the prevention or treatment of the early stages of shipping fever complex, increase feeding level to 0.5 to 2 grams per head per day.
Treatment of the above diseases:
0.2 gram Dynafac per head daily (1 gram of premix per head daily) for promoting growth, feed conversion, bloom, and full feed earlier.
The recommended 10 - milligram daily intake level should be maintained.
Cows receiving drug may not be officially tested under breed registry testing programs.

Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target:
Second, in a competitive market, the customer feels his weight and throws it around.
Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products.
As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size, there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits - which is, in effect, what the sale of private brands tends to do.
Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products?
In your sales force, will a smaller number of higher-priced, high quality salesmen serve you best, or can you make out better with a larger number of lower paid salesmen?
Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon.
There is a shortage of salesmen today.
Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term?
Do you have a long-term (5 - or 10 - yr .) marketing program?
Is it larger or fancier than you really need?
Have you publicized the cents per hour value of the company's share of insurance premiums?
Have you considered using vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria employees?
Do employees contribute their share of money to recreational facilities?
If you provide inter plant transportation, can this be replaced by available public transportation?
What sort of effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully productive?
Too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant.
Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe - say a liberal retirement plan - and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere.
Have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically.
In granting bereavement leaves, specify the maximum time off and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify.
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age.

If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria, keep an eye out for quality and price.
The long and ever increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era.
Present conservation practices regard wildlife, not as an expendable natural resource, but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped.
The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school, and they are important to proper physical development.
Other pilot programs were conducted by A + S, Babylon, New York; J. L. Hudson, Detroit; Joseph Horne, Pittsburgh.

The partners each bring to it unselfish love, and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.
It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics - not the husband.
It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role.
``A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness'', declares Dr. Calderone.
Finally, he was cooking, washing dishes, bathing the children, and even ironing - and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them.
More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home.
Furthermore, Dr. Calderone says, a certain number of docile, retiring men always have been around.
In those days, a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere.
She liked this taste of authority and independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to give it up.
An aggressive woman wants a man to demand, not knuckle under.
On the other hand, a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive - asking, psychologists say, for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable.
Too many husbands, Dr. Schillinger continues, worry about ``how well they're doing'', and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play.
Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain.
If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high, farm labor costs will also be high.

Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices.
One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers.
In each of the last, the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship; in the United States the initiation of militant anti Communism, with the repentant ex Communist in the vanguard.
These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution's case.
Not through fear of disobeying orders, as Eichmann kept trying to explain, but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's victories into a permanent light mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal, and the more outrageous the better, ``Well, let's try it''.
What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute?
Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes?
It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe.
These incidents, typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension, rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue.
Instead of Catholics' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed.
With the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives, allowing the couple free choice.
But people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without taking up arms against those who disagree with them.
The so-called ``noble experiment'' came to an inglorious end.
The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives.
This development is reflected in the action taken in February, 1961, by the general board of the National Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization in the US.
This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation, but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief.
What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months?
The name : Henry Hudson.
The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship.
He named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the ``Furious Overfall''.
Of only one could he be sure - young John Hudson, his second son.
In 1610, Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.
The issue was settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England.
For weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd.
The meeting broke up.
The great ``sea to the westwards'' was a dead end.
Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial.
The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.
Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier.
The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food.
In September 1817 at Fort Daer (Pembina) Dickson met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of Sioux, he escorted to Prairie du Chien.
Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food.
Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco.
After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice, snow fell on October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick.
Accordingly, though the practice violated the no trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade.
Indeed, no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray.
A Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart : ``My girl is none of your one-horse girls.
``Now I lay me down to sleep, The gray-backs o' er my body creep; If they should bite before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break'' ``.
A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea : ``I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days.
I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we take no notice of them now''.
Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home.

On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H. Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A. B. and M. A. degrees from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife:
Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state : ``I wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against [ the other half ]''.
In a similar vein, but writing from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6 th Alabama Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated : ``You know that my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe By a set of cowardly Skunks whose Motto is Booty.
He had no apparent comprehension of morality; he divided humanity into ``right guys'' and ``wrong guys'', and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under.
In his teens O' Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's Cafe, a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street, where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out.
Unlike the Sicilians, he additionally conducted holdups, robberies, and safe cracking expeditions, and refused to touch prostitution.
The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time.
However, this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever.
O' Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave, severely wounding him in the stomach.
Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O' Banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen.
But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate.
Indeed, a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood.
But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest.
The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones.
A tsunami is not a single wave but a series.
The highest waves, 55 feet, occurred at Pololu Valley.
But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean, they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit.
On November 4, 1952, an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula.
In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.
We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth's interior, for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled.
At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday, April 18, 1906, San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake.
Wiry and burr headed, with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals, Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper.
Chandler understood this and expected the worst.
He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh.
The final proof was a small incident.
One of his innovations was to see to it that every man - cook and clerk as well as rifleman - qualified with every weapon in the troop.
The regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side.
Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength.
It was Bob Carroll, who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen.
``Follow me''.
Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived.
He was a member of The Fighting Seventh.
These conditions are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat of world Communism.
It may be, of course, that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world - the absence of Soviet Communist power.
I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts, and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might and Soviet Myth.
Prestige, however, is only a minor part of the problem; and even then, it is a concept that can be highly misleading.
Is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago?
And this may be as far as the process will go.
A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve.
What have we to show by way of counter successes?
``Sounds exactly like last time''.
Better stay in the hotel lobby, where the walls looked good and thick.
``Let's play hero'', I said.
I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets.
We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U. N. flag.
Shy, slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside.
To find out, we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled, in the daytime at least, by the Royal Lao Army : from Attopeu, the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast, to Muong Sing, the City of Lions in the northwest, close to Communist China (map, page 250).
To go outside the few cities required permits.
And so, after a flight southeast to Savannakhet, we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak, a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from Texas.
We were miserable.
Ask Mr. Keo''.
The soldiers are fighting and the Americans are helping, he said, but in the fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself.
It takes place in the household, a rite of well wishing for myriad occasions - for the traveler, a wedding, a newborn child, the sick, the New Year, for any good purpose.
Then, one after another, the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists.
When I pressed for a purely religious definition, I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety, interfaith good will, and a small residue of ethnic loyalty.
They discovered that, although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion, only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction.
Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds.
In their first two years in high school, Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams.
However, among the girls, there are some morale enhancing compensations for not going to college.
First, the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's.
``It's people of your own kind'', a girl remarked.
For girls, the overprotection is far more pervasive.
It is significant that the Catskills, which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers, a kind of summer suburb of New York, no longer attracts them in great numbers - except for those who work there as waiters, bus boys, or counselors in the day camps.
And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities, sororities, and houses (in the House Plan Association) that have good news to impart.
In a few school districts one finds a link between school and job.
In a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student, while still in school, to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation.
In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school, I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found.
I believe the situation is improving, but the success stories need to be heavily publicized.
This last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few, if any, graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training, the whole idea of relevance disappears.
Of course, it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill.
He prefers to designate such schools as ``general'' high schools.
One vocational instructor in a city vocational school, speaking of his course in a certain field, said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city.
Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest.
The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches.
If it were primarily a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks, something which most congregations of the New Protestantism (with a few notable exceptions) have not been able to do.
The task of a congregation would be defined, according to economic integration, as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation.
The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities, worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members.
These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis.
Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century.
``Fellowship by likeness'' and ``mission by friendly contact'' form the iron cage of denominational religion.
They find deep pessimism in them.
That, I thought, is at least one thing I can find out when we meet.
The voice is light in timbre, with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage.
``The confusion is not my invention.
When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence, they may be right, I don't know, but their language is too philosophical for me.
I granted this might be so, but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously.
The latter is not reduced to the former.
``Not this.
If life and death did not both present themselves to us, there would be no inscrutability.
That is the play.
No more.
One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs''.
On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs:
As a Christian, I know I do not stand where Beckett stands, but I do see much of what he sees.
Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one's head, but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them.
In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet shrub, snowball, rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead.
Once, then - for how many years or how few does not matter - my world was bound round by fences, when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough, to twist my knee over it and pull myself up.
Other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs; the lilacs themselves, that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach; snowballs; hollyhock blossoms that, turned upside down, make pink petticoated ladies; and the little, dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere.
We showed them to each other and said ``Would you have guessed''?
A hay wagon moved slowly along the gutter, the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees, and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves.
After his passage, the street was empty again.
Cows were kept in backyard barns, boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town, and familiar to the ear, morning and evening, were the boys' coaxing voices, the thud of hooves, and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.
Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination, it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive, that they belong together.
All artistic and mythological representations, therefore, are ``imitations of imitations'' and are completely superseded by the truth value of ``dialectic'', the proper use of the inquiring intellect.
Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons, however humble, in a divine drama.
As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them, so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images.
Experience is not seen, as it is in classical rationalism, as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character, movements, and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect.
We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening.
After only eighteen years of non-interference, there were already indications of melioration, though ``in a slight degree'', to be sure.
In the pre Civil War years, the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North.
.
Calhoun dealt with this question in his ``Disquisition on Government''.
One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the Thank-Heaven-We're - not-Involved viewpoint, It Doesn't Affect Us!
I leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children, the question of what their best interests really are.
and one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves.
Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade.
It ignores the sordid financial aspects (quite conveniently, too, for his audience, who could indulge in moral indignation without visible, or even conscious, discomfort, their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage).
New England, as everyone knows, has long been schoolmaster to the Nation.
A Yale historian, writing a few years ago in The Yale Review, said : ``We in New England have long since segregated our children''.
Heidenstam was born in 1859, of a prosperous family.
``I scanned the world through printed symbol swart, And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man.
The young poet painter reproduces the French life of the streets; he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights, and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus.
It consists of fragmentary personal revelations, such as ``The Spark'':
He did not, however, find himself at once.
Heidenstam's conception, on the contrary, was to revive the present by the memories of the past.
The general effect is tragic.
Each aspired to be a god in human form, but with each it was a different kind of god.
He finds it in utter misery and desolation.
Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory.
Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases, but his primary function remains what it has always been, to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not.
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman.
Adam Smith was wrong.
The private eye is therefore a moral man; but his morality rests upon that of his society.
Holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds.
On the face of it, it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine.
Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Whimsey (the respective creations of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers) have retained Holmes' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits.
Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house, and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids.
Because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself, he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police.
It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma.
At first glance, this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors.
Also, since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer (and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command.
The completeness of the connections provide that, for N people, there are * * f lines of communication between the pairs, which can become a large number (1225) for a party of fifty guests.
The numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors.
The need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling.
Even the officer in charge, be it a captain (for small display) or a general, is restrained by monitoring.
The connective system, or network, is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective, and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory, a college, or a rural village.
Questions and, particularly, exclamations are usually channeled along informal, horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor.
But, for practical purposes, we have people who can be considered as such.
Let me quote him even more fully, for his analysis is important to my theme.
And with Progressivism the Religion of Humanity was replacing what Gabriel called Christian supernaturalism.
That John Locke's philosophy of the social contract fathered the American Revolution with its Declaration of Independence, I believe, we generally accept.
We of the liberal led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation.
The show was colorful, indeed, exuberant, but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny.
What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle - a struggle that amounts to self redefinition - to see if we can predict its future course.
I suppose we might classify Billy Graham as an old liberal.
And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : ``The paramount goal of the United States, set long ago, was to guard the rights of the individual, ensure his development, enlarge his opportunity''.
Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower?
In any event, whether society may have cancer, or merely a virus infection, the ``disease'', we shall find, is political, economical, social, and even medical.
If we were creating a wholly new society, we could insist that our social, political, economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man; best growth.
Perhaps the public's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the ``rugged capitalist entrepreneur'' no more exists in America.
But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic.
The corporation has a limited, specific place in our society.
Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity, representing a human personality, and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community.
When the proprietor dies, the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it.
In my own company, in effect a partnership, although legally a corporation, I have been able to do many things for my employees which ``normal'' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do.
Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force.
They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new.
The writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St. Joseph, Missouri.
Can they stand rigid scrutiny?
Harris J. Griston, in Shaking The Dust From Shakespeare (216), writes : ``There is not a word spoken by Shylock which one would expect from a real Jew''.
This would make anyone crafty and cruel, capable of fiendish revenge.
Let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong; he is out of place in our times.
The Leopard's Spots came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902, and in this he announced an ``unchangeable'' law.
False ideas surfeit another sector of our life.
Most assuredly ideas are invaluable.
Man, we are told, is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad.
Debate in the political arena can be productive of good.
Faulkner's total works today, and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley made his comment, or in 1939, when Mr. O' Donnell wrote his essay, reveal no such simple attitude toward the South.
He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social, cultural, or literary traditions than he was within the traditions - or possibly the regulations - governing his tenure in the post office at Oxford, Mississippi, thirty-five years ago.
Besides showing no inclination, apparently, to absent himself from his native region even for short periods, and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region, he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years.
The ingredients of Faulkner's novels and stories are by no means new with him, and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him.
Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner's chief concern is social criticism, we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil War.
Others who wrote of low characters and low life included Thomas Bangs Thorpe, creator of the Big Bear of Arkansas and Tom Owen, the Bee-Hunter; Johnson Jones Hooper, whose character Simon Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will; and George Washington Harris, whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature.
His feeling always exacted sacrifices from her.
Dr. Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century Magazine or Harper's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in The Messenger, ``so our readers will be benefited instead''.
A smart, shrewd and ambitious young man, well connected, and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people, he was bound to go far.
She could not resist the opportunity ``of showing her superiority in argument over a man'' which she had remarked as one of the ``feminine follies'' of Sara Sullam; and in her forthright way, Henrietta, who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness ``to think of men as the privileged'' and ``women as submissive and yielding'', felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair, as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College - until once, in sheer desperation, he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything.
Bertha, blue-eyed like Mamma, was from the start her mother's daughter, destined for her mother's role in life.
And just as ``Laurie'' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo March, who found him immature by her high standards, and then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy, so Joe Jastrow, who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns Hopkins, had to content himself with her younger sister, pretty Rachel.
Johnny Mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears.
``There was nothing else I could do'', the maid answered, satisfied with a rather vague explanation.
During the summers, while he was still in school, Mercer worked for his father's firm as a messenger boy.
Some years later the bank handling the Mercer liquidation received a check for $ 300000, enough to clear up the debt.
``Johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor - he's always been a good cook - and I'll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub''.
The Mercers took up residence in Brooklyn, and Mercer found a regular job in Wall Street ``misplacing stocks and bonds''.
He may be the only song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U. S. Treasury; he collaborated on a song with William Hartman Woodin, who was Secretary of the Treasury, 1932 - 33.
He has a wonderfully retentive memory.
The Americanegro Suite is in a sense an extension of the Cotton Club songs in that it is a collection of Negro songs, not for a night club, but for the concert stage.
Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important.
It is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience, the morality, the sensitivity to some code of ``right'' and ``wrong''.
Men seem almost universally to want a sense of function, that is, a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone, living or unborn, close and immediate or generalized.
A third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional conflicts, giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals.
A sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these.
In B. M. Spinley's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London, a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification, a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience.
Both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged.
In fact, I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide, continuous, and properly guided exposure to literary art.
The continuities, contrasts, and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other.
The term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience.
Understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies.
In recent years, we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts, although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy, of religion, and of the sciences.
The knowledge in virtue of which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events''.
Perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the Western world has been that of the Old and New Testament.
We must avoid the notion, suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned, that ideas are ``units'' in some way comparable to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even, for that matter, from one individual to another.

Research and development activities undertaken by the Secretary shall be coordinated or conducted jointly with the Department of Defense to the end that developments under this Act which are primarily of a civil nature will contribute to the defense of the Nation and that developments which are primarily of a military nature will, to the greatest practicable extent compatible with military and security requirements, be available to advance the purposes of this Act and to strengthen the civil economy of the Nation.

Such payments shall be made to small domestic producers of lead as long as the market price for common lead at New York, New York, as determined by the Secretary, is below 14 - 1 2 cents per pound, and such payments shall be 75 per centum of the difference between 14 - 1 2 cents per pound and the average market price for the month in which the sale occurred as determined by the Secretary.
The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter.
The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil.
Results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas; the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 * * f, with an uncertainty of 0.10 * * f.
Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium.
In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow.
Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present.
In addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards, spectroscopy, solid state physics, interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress, the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics.
Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities.
Whoever, in the United States or elsewhere, pays or offers to pay, or promises to pay, or receives on account of services rendered or to be rendered in connection with any such claim, compensation which, when added to any amount previously paid on account of such services, will exceed the amount of fees so determined by the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $ 5000 or imprisoned not more than twelve months, or both, and if any such payment shall have been made or granted, the Commission shall take such action as may be necessary to recover the same, and, in addition thereto, any such person shall forfeit all rights under this title.
The Commission shall certify to the Secretary of State, upon his request, copies of the formal submissions of claims filed pursuant to subsection (b) of section 4 of this Act for transmission to the foreign government concerned.

Mr. Speaker, for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have.
The New York Central has pointed out that this control, if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, would give the combined C.+O. - B.+O. Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central.
``The logic of creating a strong, balanced, competitive two system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B. + O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here.
We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter - the two-way B. + O. - C. + O. merger, or the three way New York Central B. + O. - C. + O. merger.
My heartiest congratulations go to their successors, Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes, who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times.
Once the full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear, President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this, even if we had to go it alone.
A naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine, would be a relatively simple operation to carry out, and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere ``.
Another strategy - bolder and tougher - was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world, destroy Castro.
More than 36 other big Navy ships are no less than a day's sailing time away.
In a broad sense, it would reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere.
Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943, the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million disabled.
In order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services, Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on (1) need, as measured by a State's population, and (2) fiscal capacity, as measured by its per capita income.
Determine the average per capita income for the U. S. based on the last three years.
Square each State's allotment percentage.
(Multiply the State product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item 10 above .)
Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State, with a pivot of 40 % State (or 60 % Federal) participation in total program costs.
For each State (except the Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii), determine the average per capita income for the last three years.
(Alaska and Hawaii had fixed Federal share percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 .)
Concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards.
Solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection.
This shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface, making it impractical to build an underground shelter.
Pre shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground.
An underground reinforced concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $ 1000 to $ 1500, depending on the type of entrance.
Ventilation.
A blower is essential for the double wall shelter and for the underground shelters.
A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed.
Forty-nine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion.

The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio.
Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem.
A flame would use up air.
In general, such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space.
Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years, but it is ``likely'' that this trend stemmed ``at least in part'' from the needs of General Motors outstripping du Pont's capacity.
It rested its decision solely on 7, which reads in pertinent part : ``[ N ] o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce.
The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition''.
At the outset, the Government's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court.
Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty + Investment Company, major stockholders in du Pont, and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee, again over a ten year period, of du Pont's General Motors stock allocable to them, as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright.
Under its plan du Pont would retain its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares.
It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude ``unnourished by sense'' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk, or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship.
He claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because (1) at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice, he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board, and (2) at the trial, he was denied the right to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim.
Daniel M. Friedman argued the cause for the United States.
We granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the Act.
On April 1, 1953, after some six months of full-time ``pioneering'', petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching, but failed to so notify his local board.
His claim was therefore ``so highly exaggerated'', the Department concluded, that it ``cast doubt upon his veracity and, consequently, upon his sincerity and good faith''.
Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board.
But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult.
It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board.
Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial.
We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context.
Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer.
I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas.
This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active, operational, interested, responsible fashion.
His first thought is about the question itself:
He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted.
How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted?
first, because it is important in itself, and, second, because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind.
I doubt, for example, that, 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan, any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals.
Under modern conditions, this is especially true of the ready reserve.
These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces, largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961.
In total, these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures, such as reduced numbers of units and installations, smaller inventories of major equipment, and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces.
The decreases, which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement, are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks, vehicles, guns, and electronic devices.
Some weapons systems have become obsolescent while still in production, and some while still under development.
Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles, which have been successfully developed, produced, and deployed, but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile.
The Strategic Air Command is the principal element of our long range nuclear capability.
I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 (the B-52 H with the new turbofan engine) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber, together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case.
If the last day (due date) for performing any act for tax purposes, such as filing a return or making a tax payment, etc., falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, you may perform that act on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
However, if their United States income is not subject to the withholding of tax on wages, their returns are due June 15, 1962, if they use a calendar year, or the 15 th day of the 6 th month after the close of their fiscal year.
You may apply for such an extension by filing Form 2688, Application For Extension Of Time To File, with the District Director of Internal Revenue for your district, or you may make your application in a letter.
Taxpayers residing or traveling in Alaska are also allowed this extension of time for filing, but those residing or traveling in Hawaii are not allowed this automatic extension.
If the check is not good and the April 15 or other due date deadline elapses, additions to the tax may be incurred.
The deductions allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income put all taxpayers on a comparable basis.
Outside salesmen deduct all expenses attributable to earning a salary, commission, or other compensation.
If you are a life tenant, you deduct allowable depreciation and depletion.
A minor is subject to tax on his own earnings even though his parent may, under local law, have the right to them and might actually have received the money.
Generally, the refund may be obtained by filing Form 1040 A accompanied by the withholding statement (Form W-2).
An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data.
Eight classrooms in three structured schools furnished 72 cases, 36 boys and 36 girls.
For instance, the following statement was rated low in compulsivity, ``She's naturally quite neat about things, but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets messy.
The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later.
The criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over - or under-achievement.
It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools, the high compulsive children do better (* * f).
The statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4.
The individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination.
Analysis means the evaluation of subparts, the comparative ratings of parts, the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements.
Roleplaying was offered as a solution - and the procedure worked as follows : all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room, where the president explained the difficulty he had, and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work out.
Ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon.
At the end of work one day, the personnel man took the applicants one at a time, asked them to sit behind the receptionist's desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes.
Turnover rates of personnel went up, production dropped, and morale was visibly reduced.
After the diagnosing, he left the course, convinced that it could do him no good.
On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior - he answered : ``I have to make decisions.
The manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up, and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard.
To accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step.
In addition, the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed.
Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me, this time, what Granny was like; and when I replied in this spirit, she corroborated my hunch.
Earlier, this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times, when she was in her room alone, it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room, as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice.
More than anything, it is the therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed, something like a spread-out deck of cards, on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together.
As I have been intimating, in the schizophrenic - and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic; this is a question which I have no wish to take up - condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are, at an unconscious level, well sorted out, but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which, even in the unconscious, have yet to become well differentiated from one another.
The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes, stems, suffixes, etc..
We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text.
Text lookup, as we will describe it, consists of three steps.
When this situation exists, the address * * f will equal * * f which was produced from * * f.
A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in * * f; similarly, as many cells are added as are required.
The number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved.
These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation.
This selection rejection process takes place as the file is read.
The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage.
Similarly, if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary, the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form.
Dominant stress is of course more than extended duration, and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last.
Dominant stress is on her luggage both in that's her luggage, where her luggage is the complement, and in there's her luggage, where it is the subject.
What is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not.
If women replaced people, it would normally have dominant stress.
In we're painting at our garage strong stress on at indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting.
Here again, in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics, but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context.
Thus to has light stress both in that was the conclusion that I came to and in that was the conclusion I came to.
In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent to on Tuesday, there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct, by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most.
Historically re is the formative that is employed also in republic, and al is the common suffix.
This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone.
Actually, none of these papers says much directly about field techniques.
Tone systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest, and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal systems.
A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands' paper.
A third explanation is suggested by Richardson's analysis of Sukuma tone.
Tonal morphophonemics, in a common case, can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone.
The design of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves.
His objective is merely to determine ``what distinctions of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography'' (59).
One other paper deals with a phonologic problem:
On the whole they maintain much the same high standard, but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter.
These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison.
This exception may be connected with Hoijer's use of a much higher percentage of verbs:
When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade, or one column or grade apart, or two or three or four, we find these differences : * * f This distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : * * f; which, divided by * * f gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart.
Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is : stem identical in 8 languages, 100 %; stem frequencies 7 and 1, 86 %; stem frequencies 4 and 4, 64 %; stem frequencies 4, 3, and 1, 57 %.
It is evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items.
In proportion as meanings are concrete, we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive.
The remote, cloudy, possible has values of its own - values of scope, stimulus, potential, and imagination.
An attempted middle course might lead to devices like a 5000 - word alphabetized dictionary from which every fiftieth word was selected.
The initiative, administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts.
For the Smith-Hughes, George-Barden, and National Defense Act of 1958, the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years was only about $ 740 million.
In most states, trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools, usually located in the larger cities.
They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas.
The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that my be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant.
Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills.
Again, one major difficulty is the local focus.
However, if Federal funds are used, it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment.
His aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training.
Part 1, below describes this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions.
The manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given.
Thus, if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge, this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate.
The industry may deliberately take a strike, not to put pressure on the union, but in order to ``educate'' the government and the customers of the industry.
We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced (the average cost curve is horizontal, and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve), and is the same for every firm (and therefore for the industry).
The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity share increases as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate.
It is convenient to assume that the union industry contract is of one year's duration.
On the one hand, the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty, independence, formal equality - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the ``flexibility of alignment'' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience.
The European customs on which international law was based were to become, by force and fiat, the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states.
To appreciate this development, we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth century philosophy.
Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence.
Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice, the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law.
It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government.
In the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law, rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system.
Someone reasonably trustworthy.
Angie knew - Speak of dangerous information!
When things got a little out of hand, they very rapidly got a lot out of hand - it seemed to be a general rule.
I cann't wait no two weeks''.
If Mr. Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause -
I tell you, I know how it is with you, my friend, I sympathize, and I'll make it a special point - a special favor - get in touch, and get some stuff just for you.
Or maybe I call you - tonight?
Never mind how much I cut it, how much I get'', and he smiled his sleepy smile again.
After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through.
and, Here, I'll take this, I was before her, you wait on me now or I don't bother with it, see!
She'd say she didn't feel good on Sunday, couldn't go to church - there'd be a little argument, but she could be stubborn - and when the old woman had gone, quick pack the things she'd need to take, all but the dress she'd wear Monday, and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight, for a dime.
``You've give me the wrong change'', said the customer sharply.
It was going to be another hot day; already the thermometer stood close to ninety.
Yes, well, it's a pity to spoil your girlish figure - which all those kittens would do anyway - but I think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so there wonn't be any more.
``I've got to get busy.
``Oh.
It's silly, childish, running after them like that.
Or someone had taken it during her first day at Honotassa.
Don't question, Rev had said, don't invite danger.
No.
Rev would never have tried to give her poison!
Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice.
``We'll go to the storehouse''.
``Can't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like, here''?
Maude was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish.
``With boots on'', Lolotte laughed softly.
``Take your cobbler's shop somewhere else.
Now why did I do that?
Miss Maude say she wonn't''.
Try to find out how happy he is with his wife, whether he plays around with women.
``Will you be coming back soon''?
I'd like to make sure.
It was ten minutes before eleven.
Of himself.
He knew Conrad had told him the truth.
Not once, in the time that he had known her, had he ever considered the possibility, not once, not for one one-thousandth of a second, of her infidelity.
The police were no longer there.
Who?
The bed was empty now.
He knew he would never see it again.
He hadn't.
He had taken her upstairs to say good night.
Except for that one morning.
For Blanche, it was only a matter of time before Stanley would propose.
Kitti was thirty years younger than Stanley, taller than Stanley, prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for, much less expect.
Blanche knew something must be causing Stanley's new, strange behavior but she never once connected it with Kitti Walker.
Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known.
Just don't tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours''.
My God, how much more do you want''?
``They found something else up there'', she said half aloud to the empty room.
``I think you had better come home''.
They'll think I did something''.
I stalled him off.
He got his hat out of the closet.
He tried to ignore what his own common sense told him, but it wasn't possible; her motives were too blatant.
A second scene flashed before his mind, the interior of the garage at the new house and the young Bartlett girl turning startled to meet him, the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light.
He felt light-headed and sick.
He had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide.
He could throw himself on the mercy of the Police Department.
Hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension.
She stood there, watching Holden come in, and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge chomp of her white teeth.
``I've been looking for them, and they're gone.
Well, I'm not sure of the color.
Tell them the truth, or something, before they come here''.
And men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms, sucking dust up once more.
He's in Boston.
And know, while all this went on, that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel.
Or long fat suitcase, for that matter?
Anything at all?
At the Dumont, a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair.
Sort things out, damn it.
Consider him seriously, therefore?
No, motive is a part of fact.
She might, conceivably, have brought one in in a large enough suitcase.
She was young, but not that young.
The boy had, apparently - if Mrs. MacReady was right in what she had told Mullins - only in recent months been forced to give up college, to work as a busboy.
He was also, if Pam North was right, a closer acquaintance of Lauren Payne's than she, now, was inclined to admit.
On the other hand, they, or it, seemed to have no legs whatever.
It was not, whatever tale was told by tails.
And possessed himself - how?
I ought to remember.
Not unless they have to.
And it makes a very poor red herring for an inside job.
At last he said, ``Well, thank you for calling, Mr. Benson.
Brain examined for thrombosis, clot or hemorrhage.
They discussed this possibility.
Pauling looked doubtful.
Youngish man on the make, Madden labeled him, and was ready to guess that in a correct, not too pushing fashion, the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions; that Mrs. Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer; that there were three children, two boys and a girl; that she was active in the Woman's Club and he in Lions, Rotary, and Jaycee; and finally, that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding day.
She had reason to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker's death.
The inspector nodded, doubting this.
He went on to personal bequests, a list of names largely unknown to him.
``Old people have their idiosyncrasies''.
His expenses ran another four or five thousand.
Motive?
In Dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month; in Medfield, perhaps twenty-five less, not all of it paid by Thayer, who could charge off one room on his expense account.
It's still unbelievable that it was murder.
The undersecretary's in there.
You mean it, Phil?
``He says I'm to take the message''.
Griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it.
``Facing us, two flights up.
``Easy does it, Phil.
he asked.
Docherty went taut : was it possible?
``Would you mind sending him up here?
These were the early departures; in half an hour the reception would be over.
The single shot would come; Hoag would carry its sound to his grave.
He ran his eye along the roof copings; almost at once a figure bulked up.
He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments, but this one, from a glance at the hall furnishings, was obviously still a functioning town house, and its owners were in residence; that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance.
He opened the inner door; the cooking odors were stronger - all over the city, at this hour, housewives would be fussing over stoves.
Was there time?
After Captain Docherty sent Arleigh Griffith for Hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before Griffith returned, buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne.
The lieutenant's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded, and as Killpath raked the comb through it, it stuck together in thatches so that it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull.
The desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room, including wooden file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons.
Makes for confusion and congestion''.
The day-watch platoon commander, Lt. Rinker, was calling out the beat assignments, but Matson couldn't make the names mean anything.
Now that's not regulation, is it''?
He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk.
``Well''?
But I'm not one damned bit sorry I went out to question the people I know in the places they hang around, and'' -
``Sorry, Orville.
If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night, Killpath would just have to go out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour; because he'd be damned if he was going to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain.
Mr. Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez, Prop., but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome.
He shrugged.
She had grown up with young Jenkins, and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice.
We're going to get married.
``I'll get my references in order'', Needham said, and though he spoke with a smile, Casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused.
Only then, when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty, did he remember his earlier problem.
For he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself.
How can I find him?
Casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was, but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head.
``Who says it's going to be published''?
``Maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what I said''.
He called the bar and grill where he had picked Burton up that afternoon.
So what?
If you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys''.
He did not bother with his radio - there would be time for that later - but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned.
She yanked away from him furiously.
``I think you stink, Tom Lord!
Print it in real big letters, an' I can cipher it out later''.
And he really feels that way, she thought.
He could move very quickly, she knew (although he seldom found occasion to do so), but he was more wiry than truly strong.
``This ain't your brand, maybe'', Lord suggested.
Lord laughed with secret amusement.
He had to depend on himself, since he was invariably miles and hours away from others.
Otherwise, she would be baited into a tantrum - teased and provoked until she lost control of herself, and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs. Joyce Lakewood.
He had a legitimate reason for wearing it.
``Why single me out on this permit deal''?
You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped' em do it.
Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes.
He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him, inadvertently shoving him into a storefront.
Why, he's going to kill me, he thought wildly.
Dimly, he heard laughter, hoots of derision, but he could not read the racket properly.
And Donna would -
It especially bothered the older hands.
Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it, which had been at midday.
Even as she called to the children, Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon.
Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel, with the other two facing him.
Give her time to miss you.
How long should I wait''?
Maybe I should withdraw my advice - no''?
And the boy will need his mother.
``We'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck''.
If the bluff failed and they ran into trouble, Brannon had told the others, they would withdraw - and he would come after his son another time.
A lamp burned inside, but Brannon, peering through the window, saw that the office was empty.
They rode to the Rockfork House, a little farther along the opposite side of the street.
``Sitting with a cup of coffee now.
``Now, listen'' - Macklin began.
``Every last one of you.
Macklin said.
No man laid a hand on him, but the threat of violence was there.
It was secured by an oversized padlock.
``Don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you''.
For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second.
He hadn't even pretended to be farming his spread.
This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands, and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot, then spent most of the day searching out the area.
Rumors of the offer Tom Horn had made at the Stockgrowers' Association meeting had leaked out by then, and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway, the prosecuting attorney, a Colonel Baird, ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning.
``Three shots in that fella' fore he hit the ground!
Even in the very area where the shooting had been done, cattle were still disappearing.
``My God, I'm shot''!
Once again, he shook his head, kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm, and had a strongly supported alibi ready.
Which would you be most scairt of - a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down''?
After the first two murders, the warning notes were rarely ignored.
No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer.
The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a single week.
By 1898, rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming.
Tell her to come here to the hotel''.
He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed.
The fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane's information had been wrong, but Curt didn't interpret it this way.
Again he stood in the darkness listening, but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor.
The startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall.
As he crossed to the side of the stall, Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer.
He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster.
``You're about as dumb as they come, Adams.
``So help me, Crouch, I'd like to kill you where you stand, but, before I do, I'm going to hear you admit killing him.
``No''?
``I heard how you outdrew Chico.
Once more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster, only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin.
As it was, his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move.
When his head came down, Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall.
He backed Jess into a corner, grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront, and drew back his right fist.
Curt moved in and picked up his gun.
This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle.
``We're going to Marshal Woods's house.
``If you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in''.
Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch.
As luck had it, he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared.
Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen.
He said no more.
But he was more than half drunk, and his faculties were dulled.
Cobb watched this with hunted eyes, his desperate hope waning by the moment.
Pat grunted.
``Shall we get out of here''?
``Not me'', he ruled decidedly.
Then maybe next time he wonn't be so quick on the trigger''.
Yet had he not visited the girl at Saw Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle.
He tightened up in a twinkling.
Cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot, Russ drew his Colt and examined it briefly.
He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind.
Sweeping a look around, he saw that he was safe for the moment.
Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan.
The truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle.
``Yeah.
The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission, and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan.
They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it didn't close in before they returned.
If the other pilots were worried, they did not show it.
His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights.
Greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home.
The same old question.
But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy, if it was the enemy, and he hadn't been spotted already.
Let's make sure first''.
Greg pushed the radio button again.
``They're Japs.
A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll, but it could be done.
Perfect, he thought.
It did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted.
The Jap's propeller flew off in pieces.
He held the controls where they had been.
I waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass.
It was stopping.
Let me pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck ``wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit'' (35 m. p. h .) ``is still in ee-faket''.
``I'm a good Baptist, and drinking & & &''.
Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side rack, I stepped on the running board; it flopped down, sprang back up and gouged my shin.
``Wanna beer''?
I ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards.
``That was Tee-wah I was talking.
Emptied the bottle.
On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash.
Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket.
I saw Johnson's bottle snatched from his hand, saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car.
Eyes like hot honey, eyes that sizzled.
But worth waiting for.
There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out, and now I was certain I'd seen her somewhere before.
``You may have seen me on TV'', she said.
What's your name, anyway?
I mean : Is advertising honest?
She told me.
Everybody left and I stayed in the pool, then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too.
He caught up with me once and grabbed me, but I was all covered with ZING - it's very slippery, you know''.
``A man was holding onto Lou, holding him up.
What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor's house and ``do whatever detectives do'', and get her clothes - and handbag containing her identification.
Seeming much relieved, she smiled one of those worth waiting for smiles, and I smiled all the way into the bedroom.
I showed her the shower and tub, and she said, smiling, ``If you really don't mind, I think I'll get clean in the shower, then soak for a few minutes in your tub.
Ten after nine.
I'll be soaking for at least half an hour''.
But the scene was not the quiet, calm scene I'd expected.
He didn't push it; Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and we'd been friends for years.
``How would I know?
``I'll pick murder.
He spat.
Thank the Lord, they still had water!
Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up.
``We're lost and burning up already'', she bit out tensely.
In a way, he couldn't blame her.
But each mile westward, she had hated him the deeper.
Without money or property, what would you have had at Baton Rouge''?
Too late, he realized that in turning, he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground, instead of atop a grade or ridge.
And then came the water - not rain, but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket.
The water level was higher than their hubs.
His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard.
Ben's eyes strained with the bitter hurt, his homely face slashed with gray and crimson.
The waters lay muddy but placid, without a ripple of movement against the wheels; there was not a match width of damp mark to show they were receding.
He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee.
If you want to get them aired''.
Naval procedure, he thought, had its moments of grim humor.
He is the oldest and most experienced of the lot.
Who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who'' -
Then, with disappointment evident upon their faces, they moved to the work.
Three days had passed since Spencer's arrest and each day had brought new dangers, new fears.
Do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now''?
The instinct of discipline has been lost.
And when he was alone again in the cabin, Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept, for he knew full well what must be done, what in the end would be done.
And Alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had, and he felt no shame.
The prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger.
He leaned closer to Alexander, squinting up at him from the deck.
And in a sudden wave of painful clarity, Alexander recognized a kinship with Spencer.
The hazel eyes met Alexander's.
And though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth, still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell.
For when he began to talk and dream all at the same time, making his plans as he went, she had begun dreaming too.
Out of the church and into his big car, it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college, his expansiveness, the quaint little pine board tourist courts, cabins really, with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling (unfrosted and naked as a streetlight, like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid, where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs, watching in between your bouts at hopscotch), a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls, an insect Highway Patrol with feelers waving.
It is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull.
And in a way the promise works out true, for whether he wants you or not, you go with him in your heart.
``Damn the world'', she thought.
You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too.
The toilet hadn't had a sincere scrubbing in years and there were things written on the walls of the little boxed in place because you couldn't keep the public out - entirely.
I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie Press; the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3, and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the fifteenth century armor, furnishings, clothes.
``That's authenticity'', he said.
Mrs. Monmouth thought of him as her discovery, and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting.
It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want, joy in his work, standing in the profession, a large and steady income.
Like certain expensive restaurants, just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself.
It is as large as all of art, interdependent, varied, multitudinous''.
``Maybe you know him.
I went to a retrospective of his work when I was eighteen, and I thought he was a contemporary of Cezanne's''.
And he is a great man.
But look at us today!
``Stimulating'' was the word for it.
``Uhhu''.
``Did you make friends easily''?
Where did you go to school''?
``Well, all right then''.
Nothing at all'', he said quietly.
``Maybe I could'', he said, surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him.
But it was a hopeful sign, he told himself.
All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself.
``Uhhu'', she muttered.
As for himself, he just didn't have the temperament for it.
All the ideologies changing from day to day, right under his eyes, so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom?
``Why not'' ? she said.
``Ciao,'' and put out her hand.
The old woman had a nephew from North Italy, a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment, and who had migrated to Canada to work on the railway.
But very mystical too.
The Pope, in the splendor of his great intellect, had neglected them a little.
It's like a flame, I guess'', she said in a dreamy tone.
Eddie shouted.
The game was resumed.
He simply turned to Mike and smiled.
By the time the fielder got his hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for home.
He did not move.
Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer.
``You didn't have to ram him''.
He arose slowly and brushed himself off.
``One more and I'm coming out there''!
There was much shouting and screaming.
Mike went over to Phil and stood over him.
``I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club'', Phil said slowly.
``I'm doing you a favor'', Eddie said quickly.
``Listen!
Suddenly his voice grew hard.
My batting average & & &''.
What the hell do you think baseball is?
His lips felt glued together.
Frankie asked.
Then Frankie said : ``What are you gonna do''?
Phil looked up.
``Springfield come in tomorrow''?
What else did Eddie have to say''?
Then they had always been romping around him on these walks, yelping with delight, dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions, returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws.
How in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business, raise a family, be on half a dozen boards, work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case?
There was no compulsion behind them.
He went down to Mills and Bradley's Hardware Store and bought a full set of carpenter's tools, including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr. Mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling, whatever they were.
It gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments.
Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget.
Perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench - someone who knew what he was about.
There wasn't any such thing any more.
While Mr. Blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench, Mr. Crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar.
Instead of being depressed by this news, Mr. Crombie was actually relieved.
``Oh, that's wonderful'', cried Mrs. Crombie.
